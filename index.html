                I'm specialized in web developement, on the MERN (Mongodb, Express, React, Nodejs) Stack. I work with it since 2 years now. Like you probably know it Nodejs Isnt the most performing back-end technology so im actually learning Golang.

            </h2>
            <p>
                I begin in UX/UI Design, im using Adobe suite and Figma. I started learning it because i think every good front-end developer should know how to think a design.

                <p>I started developing my first website at 14yo it was something you don't want to see, but it introduces me to the wonderful world of code ❤️.
                        It was a revelation, I wanted to become a software engineer to do so at the age of 17yo I took my chance 
                        I go to Paris and I tried the famous piscine from 42 we were 300 (Like the movie yeah it's badass!) 
                        I wasn't knowing it at the time but the piscine had 50% of people who retried it. 
                        I was the youngest and probably not the best but after the 3 amazing weeks of my life,
